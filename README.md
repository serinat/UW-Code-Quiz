### UW-Code-Quiz

- The objective of homework 4 is to generate a pop quiz about your topic of choice. I chose to do one about myself, thought it would be fun to see how well my family & friends know me! The last few days I spent the majority of the time building my HTML page using bootstrap and font-awesome (my icon wouldn't work so I spent about an hour on it until I finally realized I was referencing a different version of fontawesome - ugh live and learn). From bootstrap I used card and form layout to simplify, organize and display my questions, results and score sections. Per usual I found the bootstrap CDN to be very useful and user-friendly. I also messed around a bit with CSS to increase the opacity of my background image, to float header elements, and to center most of the document. I've started pseudocoding the functionality of the quiz, I should be able to finish by tomorrow! Stay tuned..
