### UW-Code-Quiz

- The objective of homework 4 is to generate a pop quiz about your topic of choice. I chose to do one about myself,thought it would be fun to see how well my family & friends know me! The last few days I spent the majority of the time building my HTML page using bootstrap and font-awesome (my icon wouldn't work so I spent about an hour on it until I finally realized I was referencing a different version of fontawesome - ugh live and learn). From bootstrap I used card and form layout to simplify, organize and display my questions, results and score sections. Per usual I found the bootstrap CDN to be very useful and user-friendly. I also messed around a bit with CSS to increase the opacity of my background image, to float header elements, and to center most of the document. I've started pseudocoding the functionality of the quiz, I should be able to finish by tomorrow! Stay tuned..

- Is it almost midnight yet?? This was probably the most challenging JS code I've had to generate. Even with the help of tutors, classmates, family friends, etc., I spent hours on end trying to get the functionality to work. Most of it is working, not sure I have the time (nor energy) to add in the time element. At some point I do want to incorporate as I can see it being useful in many applications. Challenges were many including timer, code placement and clearing alerts after refreshing. I was also trying to figure out how to highlight the correct answer if the user chose the wrong answer. I plan on tackling these aspects after a break!

- UPDATE: Timer implemented, however, at some point its countdown is funky.
